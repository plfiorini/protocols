    <request name="set_surface_role">
      <description summary="assign a role to a surface">
        Assign a role to a surface.

        The compositor handles surfaces depending on their role.
        See the explaination below.

        This request fails if the surface already has another role.

        == Surfaces with desktop role ==

        Desktop surfaces are placed below all other surfaces and are used
        to show the actual desktop view with icons, search results or
        controls the user will interact with. What to show depends on the
        shell implementation.

        Desktop surfaces are placed according to the output coordinates.
        No size is imposed to those surfaces, the shell has to resize
        them according to output size.

        Only one surface per output can have the desktop role.

        Call this request on the same surface multiple times to change
        output and thus surface position.

        == Surfaces with config role ==

        A configuration surface is shown when the user wants to configure
        panel or desktop views.

        Only one surface per output can have the config role.

        TODO: This should grab the input like popup menus, right?

        == Surfaces with overlay role ==

        Overlays are special surfaces that shows for a limited amount
        of time.  Such surfaces are useful to display things like volume,
        brightness and status changes.

        Compositors may decide to show those surfaces in a layer above
        all surfaces, even full screen ones.

        == Surfaces with notification role ==

        Notification surfaces display informative content for a limited
        amount of time.  The compositor may decide to show them in a corner
        depending on the configuration.

        These surfaces are shown in a layer above all other surfaces except
        for full screen ones.

        == Surfaces with lock role ==

        The lock surface is shown by the compositor when the session is
        locked, users interact with it to unlock the session.

        Compositors should move lock surfaces to 0,0 in output
        coordinates space and hide all other surfaces for security sake.
        For the same reason it is recommended that clients make the
        lock surface as big as the screen.

        Only one surface per output can have the lock role.

    <!-- Lock and unlock -->

    <request name="lock">
      <description summary="lock the session">
        Tell the compositor to initiate the lock sequence.

        When the compositor receives this request it hides all surfaces,
        disable all input for them and go in idle mode (usually it turns off
        the screens or run the screen saver).

        Input events resume the compositor (it turns the screens on or
        kills the screen saver), however surfaces keep being hidden.

        At this point the kf5_session.prepare_lock_surfaces event is emitted
        and the shell decides what to do.

    </request>

    <request name="unlock">
      <description summary="unlock the session">
        Tell the compositor to unlock the session.

        This resumes the compositor and restores all surfaces to
        their initial state.

        The shell at this point can destroy lock surfaces to save
        resources.

	Whether or not the shell actually implements locking, it MUST send the
        kf5_shell.unlock request to let the normal desktop resume.

        Tell the shell we want it to create and set its surfaces such as

        The shell will then call kf5_shell.desktop_ready when all
        surfaces are ready.

    <request name="desktop_ready">
      <description summary="desktop is ready to be shown">
	Tell the compositor, that enough desktop elements have been drawn
	to make the desktop look ready for use.

        During start-up, the compositor can wait for this request with a
        black screen and fade the desktop in when this request is called.

        If the shell surfaces take a long time to initialize, we avoid
	showing temporary garbage.
